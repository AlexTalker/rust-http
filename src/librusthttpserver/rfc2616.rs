/**
 * HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats
 * for the representation of date/time stamps:
 *
 *    Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123
 *    Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036
 *    Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format
 *
 * The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents
 * a fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123 [8] (an update to
 * RFC 822 [9]). The second format is in common use, but is based on the
 * obsolete RFC 850 [12] date format and lacks a four-digit year.
 * HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse the date value MUST accept
 * all three formats (for compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they MUST
 * only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values
 * in header fields. See section 19.3 for further information.
 *
 *    Note: Recipients of date values are encouraged to be robust in
 *    accepting date values that may have been sent by non-HTTP
 *    applications, as is sometimes the case when retrieving or posting
 *    messages via proxies/gateways to SMTP or NNTP.
 *
 * All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time
 * (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly
 * equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the
 * first two formats by the inclusion of "GMT" as the three-letter
 * abbreviation for time zone, and MUST be assumed when reading the
 * asctime format. HTTP-date is case sensitive and MUST NOT include
 * additional LWS beyond that specifically included as SP in the
 * grammar.
 *
 *     HTTP-date    = rfc1123-date | rfc850-date | asctime-date
 *     rfc1123-date = wkday "," SP date1 SP time SP "GMT"
 *     rfc850-date  = weekday "," SP date2 SP time SP "GMT"
 *     asctime-date = wkday SP date3 SP time SP 4DIGIT
 *     date1        = 2DIGIT SP month SP 4DIGIT
 *                    ; day month year (e.g., 02 Jun 1982)
 *     date2        = 2DIGIT "-" month "-" 2DIGIT
 *                    ; day-month-year (e.g., 02-Jun-82)
 *     date3        = month SP ( 2DIGIT | ( SP 1DIGIT ))
 *                    ; month day (e.g., Jun  2)
 *     time         = 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT ":" 2DIGIT
 *                    ; 00:00:00 - 23:59:59
 *     wkday        = "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed"
 *                  | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat" | "Sun"
 *     weekday      = "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday"
 *                  | "Thursday" | "Friday" | "Saturday" | "Sunday"
 *     month        = "Jan" | "Feb" | "Mar" | "Apr"
 *                  | "May" | "Jun" | "Jul" | "Aug"
 *                  | "Sep" | "Oct" | "Nov" | "Dec"
 *
 *    Note: HTTP requirements for the date/time stamp format apply only
 *    to their usage within the protocol stream. Clients and servers are
 *    not required to use these formats for user presentation, request
 *    logging, etc.
